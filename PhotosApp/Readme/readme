This readme is based on what architecture and patterns the project is following.

ARCHITECTURE:
This project is following MVVM
Reason:
Separated all data driven code like API's, data Model references, and testable code in to ViewModel so evey data related logic remains in our ViewModel.
We can easily test our logic from viewModel as i have also added an example of a dummy a test case.
Easily scalable with independent business logic files if our app grows

SOLID:
Following Solid Principles.
Every class has its own responsibility like APIManager calls api and return model after Parsing
Photo Handler class only apply photo to any uiimageView with activity indicators handling inside it
No Base class is edited based on any other requirement, instead protocols are used.
